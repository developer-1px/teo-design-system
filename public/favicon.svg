  <!-- Using Naver Green because favors usually need color pop? 
       Or stay monochrome as per rollback? 
       "minimal design kit" usually implies monochrome.
       But icons often need to stand out.
       Let's use the Green Dot as a subtle brand link, or stick to white?
       User rejected the "Box" icon which had a green dot.
       User liked the "Wordmark" which was monochrome.
       I will use White text on Black bg. 
       Maybe add the green dot? The user said "dot를 우하단에 포인트로 추가하고" previously (for layout icon).
       Let's use White for now to be safe with "Minimal".
