# PRD: Self-Documenting Design System (Fusion Hypernova)

> **"Code is the single source of truth, but Documentation is the lens through which we verify it."**

## 1. Problem Definition & Why
*   **Context:** We use AI Agents for coding, which creates a "blindness" to the overall architectural progress.
*   **Core Need:** A visible, navigable interface to track progress, visualize the Design System components, and verify the aesthetic quality of both the *Components* and the *Documentation* itself.
*   **Goal:** Build a "Living Documentation" site where the documentation grow organically with the code.
*   **Value Proposition:**
    1.  **Observability:** Instant visual verification of AI-generated code.
    2.  **Quality Assurance:** The Documentation site *is* the first consumer of the Design System, serving as a dogfooding verification platform.
    3.  **Deliverable:** The final output includes a polished technical documentation site.

## 2. Technical Strategy: "The Monolithic Docs"
Instead of separating documentation into a silo (like an isolated Storybook or separate Astro repo), we will embed the documentation engine directly into the main application.

### Chosen Stack: **Vite + MDX + React Router**
*   **Why?**
    *   **Unified Pipeline:** Shares the exact same `vite.config.ts`. No duplicate configuration for `vanilla-extract`.
    *   **Design Control:** We have 100% control over the layout, typography, and "Design of the Docs" (User Requirement).
    *   **Live Fidelity:** Components render exactly as they do in the app because they *are* in the app.

## 3. Key Requirements

### 3.1. Infrastructure (Docs Engine)
*   **MDX Support:** Capable of rendering `.mdx` files as React components.
*   **Auto-Routing:** Mapping `/docs/*` URLs to file paths (e.g., `src/pages/docs/buttons.mdx` -> `/docs/buttons`).
*   **Layout Wrapper:** A dedicated layout for docs (Sidebar navigation, Table of Contents, Prose styles).

### 3.2. Content Features
*   **Live Canvas:** A `<Canvas>` or `<Playground>` component to render code examples effectively.
*   **Props Table:** (Future) Automated extraction of Typescript interfaces.
*   **Design Tokens Showcase:** Specialized blocks to visualize Colors, Spacing, and Typography tokens.

### 3.3. Experience (UX)
*   **Theme Switcher:** Validate Design System's theming capabilities instantly.
*   **Fast Navigation:** Instant client-side transitions between doc pages.

## 4. Implementation Plan (Phased)

### Phase 1: The Skeleton (Current Task)
*   [ ] Install `@mdx-js/rollup` and configure Vite.
*   [ ] Create the foundational `DocsLayout`.
*   [ ] Create the first PRD document as a live MDX page at `/docs/prd`.

### Phase 2: The Components
*   [ ] Implement rich typography styles for Markdown content (Headings, Code blocks).
*   [ ] Create a basic Sidebar navigation structure.

### Phase 3: Automation
*   [ ] Automate sidebar generation based on file structure.

## 5. Success Metrics
*   **Zero-Config Styling:** `vanilla-extract` styles work in MDX without extra setup.
*   **Visual Logic:** The documentation page itself must look "Modern & Premium" (User's core rule).
